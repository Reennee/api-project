Description
The project consists of three files:

index.html: The HTML file that defines the structure of the page.
style.css: The CSS file that defines the styles for the page.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for the page.
The index.html file defines the structure of the page. It includes the <head> tag, the <body> tag, and the <script> tag. The <head> tag includes the title of the page and the link to the style.css file. The <body> tag includes the h1 element, the div element with the id hot-100, the button element, and the script tag. The h1 element displays the title of the page. The div element with the id hot-100 will be used to display the list of songs. The button element is used to get the list of songs. The script tag includes the JavaScript code for the page.

The style.css file defines the styles for the page. It defines the fonts, colors, and sizes for the page elements.

The script.js file handles the logic for the page. It gets the list of songs from the Billboard API and displays the list of songs in the div element with the id hot-100.
